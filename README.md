# Hi, I'm [Your Name] 👋

Backend-focused developer working mainly with Java and Spring Boot.  
I like building APIs that behave, databases that don’t lie, and code that’s readable six months later.

## 🛠 Tech I Work With
- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Data JPA
- REST APIs
- SQL / Relational Databases
- Git

## 📌 What I’m Working On
- Backend services with Spring Boot
- Improving API design and data modeling
- Learning more about system design and backend architecture

## 📈 What I Care About
- Clean, maintainable code

- Fixing bugs properly, not just making them quiet
